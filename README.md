# Nacon-Test

I made this project in 2D and I implemented points 1 to 5 plus the procedural generation of the map with the tunnels.
To create the procedural map I implemented the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.

I have also implemented saves so that the player is able to continue a game, which he left, at any time.
the saves also work for the procedural map, in this way, if the player wants to continue a game started in this mode,
the same map, previously created procedurally, will be recreated.
